## TJA1145A

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

Rev. 2 - 23 September 2020

## 1. General description

The TJA1145A is a high-speed CAN transceiver that provides an interface between a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical two-wire CAN bus. The transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the automotive industry, providing differential transmit and receive capability to (a microcontroller with) a CAN protocol controller.

The TJA1145A features very low power consumption in Standby and Sleep modes and supports ISO 11898-2:2016 compliant CAN Partial Networking by means of a selective wake-up function.

A dedicated implementation of the partial networking function has been embedded into the FD variants TJA1145AT/FD and TJA1145ATK/FD (see Section 7.3.2 for further details on CAN FD). This function is called 'FD-passive' and is the ability to ignore CAN FD frames while waiting for a valid wake-up frame in Sleep/Standby mode. This additional feature of partial networking is the perfect fit for networks that support both CAN FD and standard CAN 2.0 communications. It allows normal CAN controllers that do not need to communicate CAN FD messages during CAN FD communication without generating bus errors.

Advanced power management regulates the supply throughout the node and supports local and remote wake-up functionality. I/O levels are automatically adjusted to the I/O levels of the controller, allowing the TJA1145A to interface directly with 3.3 V to 5 V microcontrollers. An SPI interface is provided for transceiver control and for retrieving status information. Bus connections are truly floating when power is off.

The TJA1145A implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. This implementation enables reliable communication in the CAN FD fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.

These features make the TJA1145A the ideal choice for high-speed CAN networks containing nodes that are always connected to the battery supply line but, in order to minimize current consumption, are only active when required by the application.

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

## 7. Functional description

The TJA1145A is a stand-alone high-speed CAN transceiver containing a variety of fail-safe and diagnostic features that offer enhanced system reliability and advanced power management. The transceiver combines the functionality of the TJA1043 with ISO 11898-2:2016 compliant CAN partial networking and autonomous bus biasing.

## 7.1 System controller

The system controller manages register configuration and controls the internal functions of the TJA1145A. Detailed device status information is collected and made available to the microcontroller.

## 7.1.1 Operating modes

The system controller contains a state machine that supports five operating modes: Normal, Standby, Sleep, Overtemp and Off. The state transitions are illustrated in Figure 4.

## 7.1.1.1 Normal mode

Normal mode is the active operating mode. In this mode, the TJA1145A is fully operational. All device hardware is available and can be activated (see Table 4).

Normal mode can be selected from Standby or Sleep mode via an SPI command (MC = 111).

## 7.1.1.2 Standby mode

Standby mode is the first-level power-saving mode of the TJA1145A, featuring low current consumption. The transceiver is unable to transmit or receive data in Standby mode, but the INH pin remains active so voltage regulators controlled by this pin will be active.

If remote CAN wake-up is enabled (CWE = 1; see Table 22), the receiver monitors bus activity for a wake-up request. The bus pins are biased to GND (via Ri(cm)) when the bus is inactive and at approximately 2.5 V when there is activity on the bus (autonomous biasing). CAN wake-up can occur via a standard wake-up pattern or via a selective wake-up frame (selective wake-up is enabled when CPNC = PNCOK = 1; otherwise standard wake-up is enabled).

Pin RXD is forced LOW when any enabled wake-up or interrupt event is detected (see Section 7.6).

The TJA1145A switches to Standby mode:

- from Off mode if the battery voltage rises above the power-on detection threshold, Vth(det)pon .
- from Overtemp mode if the chip temperature falls below the overtemperature protection release threshold, Tth(rel)otp .
- from Sleep mode on the occurrence of a wake-up or interrupt event (see Section 7.6)
- from Normal or Sleep mode via an SPI command (MC = 100)
- from Normal mode if Sleep mode is selected via an SPI command (MC = 001) while a wake-up event is pending or all wake-up sources are disabled

## 7.1.1.3 Sleep mode

Sleep mode is the second-level power saving mode of the TJA1145A. In Sleep mode, the transceiver behaves as in Standby Mode with the exception that pin INH is set to a high-ohmic state. Voltage regulators controlled by this pin will be switched off, and the current into pin BAT will be reduced to a minimum.

Any enabled wake-up or interrupt event (except SPIF), or an SPI command (provided a valid VIO voltage is connected), will wake up the transceiver from Sleep mode.

Sleep mode can be selected from Normal or Standby mode via an SPI command (MC = 001). The TJA1145A will switch to Sleep mode on receipt of this command, provided there are no pending wake-up events and at least one regular wake-up source (CAN bus or WAKE pin; see Section 7.6) is enabled. Any attempt to enter Sleep mode while one of these conditions has not been met will cause the TJA1145A to switch to Standby mode.

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

The TJA1145A will also be forced to switch to Sleep mode after td(uvd-sleep) if a VCC of VIO undervoltage event is detected (VCC/VIO &lt; Vuvd(VCC)/Vuvd(VIO) for longer than td(uvd)). In this event, all pending wake-up events will be cleared. CAN wake-up (CWE = 1) and local wake-up via the WAKE pin (WPFE = WPRE = 1) are enabled in order to avoid a system deadlock (see Section 7.11) and selective wake-up is disabled (CPNC = 0).

Status bit FSMS in the Main status register (Table 6) indicates whether a transition to Sleep mode was selected via an SPI command (FSMS = 0) or was forced by an undervoltage event on VCC or VIO (FSMS = 1). This bit can be read after the TJA1145A wakes up from Sleep mode to allow the settings of CWE, WPFE, WPRE and CPNC to be re-adjusted if an undervoltage event forced the transition to Sleep mode (FSMS = 1).

## 7.1.1.4 Off mode

The TJA1145A will be in Off mode when the battery voltage is too low to supply the IC. This is the default mode when the battery is first connected. The TJA1145A will switch to Off mode from any mode if the battery voltage drops below the power-off threshold (Vth(det)poff). In Off mode, the CAN pins and pin INH are in a high-ohmic state.

When the battery supply voltage rises above the power-on threshold (Vth(det)pon), the TJA1145A starts to boot up, triggering an initialization procedure. The TJA1145A will switch to Standby mode after tstartup.

## 7.1.1.5 Overtemp mode

Overtemp mode is provided to prevent TJA1145A being damaged by excessive temperatures. The TJA1145A switches immediately to Overtemp mode from Normal mode when the global chip temperature rises above the overtemperature protection activation threshold, Tth(act)otp .

To help prevent the loss of data due to overheating, the TJA1145A issues a warning when the IC temperature rises above the overtemperature warning threshold (Tth(warn)otp). When this happens, status bit OTWS is set and an overtemperature interrupt is generated (OTW = 1), if enabled (OTWE = 1).

In Overtemp mode, the CAN transmitter and receiver are disabled and the CAN pins are in a high-ohmic state. Wake-up events will not be detected, but a pending wake-up will still be signalled by a LOW level on pin RXD, which will persist after the overtemperature event has been cleared.

The TJA1145A exits Overtemp mode:

- and switches to Standby mode if the chip temperature falls below the overtemperature protection release threshold, Tth(rel)otp
- if the device is forced to switch to Off mode (VBAT &lt; Vth(det)poff)

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

## 7.2 High-speed CAN transceiver

The integrated high-speed CAN transceiver is designed for active communication at bit rates up to 1 Mbit/s, providing differential transmit and receive capability to a CAN protocol controller. The transceiver is ISO 11898-2:2016 compliant (defining high-speed CAN with selective wake-up functionality and autonomous bus biasing). The CAN transmitter is supplied via pin VCC while the CAN receiver is supplied via pin BAT. The TJA1145A includes additional timing parameters on loop delay symmetry to ensure reliable communication in fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s, as used in CAN FD networks.

The CAN transceiver supports autonomous CAN biasing, which helps to minimize RF emissions. CANH and CANL are always biased to 2.5 V when the transceiver is in Active or Listen-only modes (CMC = 01/10/11).

Autonomous biasing is active in CAN Offline mode - to 2.5 V if there is activity on the bus (CAN Offline Bias mode) and to GND if there is no activity on the bus for t &gt; tto(silence) (CAN Offline mode).

This is useful when the node is disabled due to a malfunction in the microcontroller or when CAN partial networking is enabled. The TJA1145A ensures that the CAN bus is correctly biased to avoid disturbing ongoing communication between other nodes. The autonomous CAN bias voltage is derived directly from VBAT.

## 7.2.1 CAN operating modes

The integrated CAN transceiver supports four operating modes: Active, Listen-only, Offline and Offline Bias (see Figure 5). The CAN transceiver operating mode depends on the TJA1145A operating mode and on the setting of bits CMC in the CAN control register (Table 7).

When the TJA1145A is in Normal mode, the CAN transceiver operating mode (Offline, Active or Listen-only) can be selected via bits CMC in the CAN control register (Table 7). When the TJA1145A is in Standby or Sleep modes, the transceiver is forced to Offline or Offline Bias mode (depending on bus activity).

## 7.2.1.1 CAN Active mode

In CAN Active mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via CANH and CANL. The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data, which is output on pin RXD. The transmitter converts digital data generated by the CAN controller (input on pin TXD) into analog signals suitable for transmission over the CANH and CANL bus lines.

CAN Active mode is selected when CMC = 01 or 10. When CMC = 01, VCC undervoltage detection is enabled and the transceiver switches to CAN Offline or CAN Offline Bias mode when the voltage on VCC drops below Vuvd(VCC). When CMC = 10, VCC undervoltage detection is disabled. The transmitter will remain active until the TJA1145A is forced into Sleep mode by the VCC undervoltage event; the transceiver will then switch to CAN Offline or CAN Offline Bias mode.

The CAN transceiver is in Active mode when:

- the TJA1145A is in Normal mode (MC = 111) and the CAN transceiver has been enabled by setting bits CMC in the CAN control register to 01 or 10 (see Table 7) and:

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

- -if CMC = 01, the voltage on pin VCC is above the VCC undervoltage detection threshold (Vuvd(VCC))

If pin TXD is held LOW (e.g. by a short-circuit to GND) when CAN Active mode is selected via bits CMC, the transceiver will not enter CAN Active mode but will switch to or remain in CAN Listen-only mode. It will remain in Listen-only mode until pin TXD goes HIGH in order to prevent a hardware and/or software application failure from driving the bus lines to an unwanted dominant state.

In CAN Active mode, the CAN bias voltage is derived from VCC.

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

The application can determine whether the CAN transceiver is ready to transmit/receive data or is disabled by reading the CAN Transceiver Status (CTS) bit in the Transceiver Status Register (Table 8).

## 7.2.1.2 CAN Listen-only mode

CAN Listen-only mode allows the TJA1145A to monitor bus activity while the transceiver is inactive, without influencing bus levels. This facility could be used by development tools that need to listen to the bus but do not need to transmit or receive data or for software-driven selective wake-up. Dedicated microcontrollers could be used for selective wake-up, providing an embedded low-power CAN engine designed to monitor the bus for potential wake-up events.

In Listen-only mode the CAN transmitter is disabled, reducing current consumption. The CAN receiver and CAN biasing remain active. This enables the host microcontroller to switch to a low-power mode in which an embedded CAN protocol controller remains active, waiting for a signal to wake up the microcontroller.

The CAN transceiver is in Listen-only mode when:

- the TJA1145A is in Normal mode and CMC = 11

The CAN transceiver will not leave Listen-only mode while TXD is LOW or CAN Active mode is selected with CMC = 01 or 10 while the voltage on VCC is below the undervoltage threshold, Vuvd(VCC).

## 7.2.1.3 CAN Offline and Offline Bias modes

In CAN Offline mode, the transceiver monitors the CAN bus for a wake-up event, provided CAN wake-up detection is enabled (CWE = 1). CANH and CANL are biased to GND.

CAN Offline Bias mode is the same as CAN Offline mode, with the exception that the CAN bus is biased to 2.5 V. This mode is activated automatically when activity is detected on the CAN bus while the transceiver is in CAN Offline mode. The transceiver will return to CAN Offline mode if the CAN bus is silent (no CAN bus edges) for longer than tto(silence).

The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline mode from CAN Active mode or CAN Listen-only mode if:

- the TJA1145A switches to Standby or Sleep mode OR
- the TJA1145A is in Normal mode and CMC = 00

provided the CAN-bus has been inactive for at least tto(silence). If the CAN-bus has been inactive for less than tto(silence), the CAN transceiver switches first to CAN Offline Bias mode and then to CAN Offline mode once the bus has been silent for tto(silence).

The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline/Offline Bias mode from CAN Active mode if CMC = 01 and the voltage on VCC drops below the undervoltage threshold or if CMC = 10 and the TJA1145A switches to Sleep mode in response to a VCC undervoltage event.

The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline mode:

- from CAN Offline Bias mode if no activity is detected on the bus (no CAN edges) for t &gt; t to(silence) OR

<!-- image -->

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

- when the TJA1145A switches from Off or Overtemp mode to Standby mode

The CAN transceiver switches from CAN Offline mode to CAN Offline Bias mode if:

- a standard wake-up pattern is detected on the CAN bus OR
- the CAN transceiver is in Normal mode, CMC = 01 or 10 and VCC &lt; 90 %

## 7.2.1.4 CAN Off mode

The CAN transceiver is switched off completely with the bus lines floating when:

- the TJA1145A switches to Off or Overtemp mode OR
- VBAT falls below the CAN receiver undervoltage detection threshold, Vuvd(CAN)

It will be switched on again on entering CAN Offline mode when VBAT rises above the undervoltage recovery threshold (Vuvr(CAN)) and the CAN transceiver is no longer in Off/Overtemp mode. CAN Off mode prevents reverse currents flowing from the bus when the battery supply to the CAN transceiver is lost.

## 7.2.2 CAN standard wake-up (partial networking not enabled)

If the CAN transceiver is in Offline mode and CAN wake-up is enabled (CWE = 1), but CAN selective wake-up is disabled (CPNC = 0 or PNCOK = 0), the TJA1145A will monitor the bus for a standard wake-up pattern.

A filter at the receiver input prevents unwanted wake-up events occurring due to automotive transients or EMI. This filtering helps avoid spurious wake-up events. A spurious wake-up sequence could be triggered by, for example, a dominant clamped bus or by dominant phases due to noise or spikes on the bus.

The TJA1145A wakes up from Standby or Sleep mode when a dedicated wake-up pattern (specified in ISO 11898-2:2016) is detected on the bus.

The wake-up pattern consists of:

- a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom) followed by
- a recessive phase of at least twake(busrec) followed by
- a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom)

Dominant or recessive bits between the above mentioned phases that are shorter than twake(busdom) and twake(busrec) respectively are ignored.

The complete dominant-recessive-dominant pattern must be received within tto(wake)bus to be recognized as a valid wake-up pattern (see Figure 6). Otherwise, the internal wake-up logic is reset. The complete wake-up pattern will then need to be retransmitted to trigger a wake-up event. Pin RXD remains HIGH until the wake-up event has been triggered.

When a valid CAN wake-up pattern is detected on the bus, wake-up bit CW in the Transceiver event status register is set (see Table 19) and pin RXD is driven LOW. If the TJA1145A was in Sleep mode when the wake-up pattern was detected, it will switch pin INH to VBAT to activate external voltage regulators (e.g. for supplying VCC and VIO) and enter Standby mode.

## 7.3 CAN partial networking

Partial networking allows nodes in a CAN network to be selectively activated in response to dedicated wake-up frames (WUF). Only nodes that are functionally required are active on the bus while the other nodes remain in a low-power mode until needed.

If both CAN wake-up (CWE = 1) and CAN selective wake-up (CPNC = 1) are enabled, and the partial networking registers are configured correctly (PNCOK = 1), the transceiver monitors the bus for dedicated CAN wake-up frames.

## 7.3.1 Wake-up frame (WUF)

A wake-up frame is a CAN frame according to ISO 11898-1:2015, consisting of an identifier field (ID), a Data Length Code (DLC), a data field and a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code including the CRC delimiter.

The wake-up frame format, standard (11-bit) or extended (29-bit) identifier, is selected via bit IDE in the Frame control register (Table 12).

A valid WUF identifier is defined and stored in the ID registers (Table 10). An ID mask can be defined to allow a group of identifiers to be recognized as valid by an individual node. The identifier mask is defined in the mask registers (Table 11), where a 1 means 'don't care'.

In the example illustrated in Figure 7, based on the standard frame format, the 11-bit identifier is defined as 0x1A0. The identifier is stored in ID registers 2 (0x29) and 3 (0x2A). The three least significant bits of the ID mask, bits 2 to 4 of Mask register 2 (0x2D) are set to 1, which means that the corresponding identifier bits are 'don't care'. This means that any of eight different identifiers will be recognized as valid in the received WUF (from 0x1A0 to 0x1A7).

The data field indicates which nodes are to be woken up. Within the data field, groups of nodes can be pre-defined and associated with bits in a data mask. By comparing the incoming data field with the data mask, multiple groups of nodes can be woken up simultaneously with a single wake-up message.

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

The data length code (bits DLC in the Frame control register; Table 12) determines the number of data bytes (between 0 and 8) expected in the data field of a CAN wake-up frame. If one or more data bytes are expected (DLC  0000), at least one bit in the data field of the received wake-up frame must be set to 1 and at least one equivalent bit in the associated data mask register in the transceiver (see Table 13) must also be set to 1 for a successful wake-up. Each matching pair of 1s indicates a group of nodes to be activated (since the data field is up to 8 byes long, up to 64 groups of nodes can be defined).

If DLC = 0000, a node will wake up if the WUF contains a valid identifier and the received data length code is 0000, regardless of the values stored in the data mask. If DLC  0000 and all data mask bits are set to 0, the device cannot be woken up via the CAN bus (note that all data mask bits are set to 1 by default; see Table 31). If a WUF contains a valid ID but the DLCs (in the Frame control register and in the WUF) don't match, the data field is ignored and no nodes are woken up.

In the example illustrated in Figure 8, the data field consists of a single byte (DLC = 1). This means that the data field in the incoming wake-up frame is evaluated against data mask 7 (stored at address 6Fh; see Table 13 and Figure 9). Data mask 7 is defined as 10101000 in the example. This means that up to three groups of nodes could be woken up (group 1, 3 and 5) if the respective bits in the data frame are also set to 1.

The received message shown in Figure 8 could, potentially, wake up four groups of nodes: groups 2, 3, 4 and 5. Two matches are found (groups 3 and 5) when the message data bits are compared with the configured data mask (DM7).

Optionally, the data length code and the data field can be excluded from the evaluation of the wake-up frame. If bit PNDM = 0, only the identifier field is evaluated to determine if the frame contains a valid wake-up message. If PNDM = 1 (the default value), the data field is included in the wake-up filtering.

When PNDM = 0, a valid wake-up message is detected and a wake-up event is captured (and CW is set to 1) when:

- the identifier field in the received wake-up frame matches the pattern in the ID registers after filtering AND
- the CRC field in the received frame (including a recessive CRC delimiter) was received without error

When PNDM = 1, a valid wake-up message is detected when:

- the identifier field in the received wake-up frame matches the pattern in the ID registers after filtering AND
- the frame is not a Remote frame AND

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

- the data length code in the received message matches the configured data length code (bits DLC) AND
- if the data length code is greater than 0, at least one bit in the data field of the received frame is set and the corresponding bit in the associated data mask register is also set AND
- the CRC field in the received frame (including a recessive CRC delimiter) was received without error

If the TJA1145A receives a CAN message containing errors (e.g. a 'stuffing' error) transmitted in advance of the ACK field, an internal error counter is incremented. If a CAN message is received without any errors appearing in front of the ACK field, the counter is decremented. Data received after the CRC delimiter and before the next SOF is ignored by the partial networking module. If the counter overflows (counter &gt; 31), a frame detect error is captured (PNFDE = 1) and the device wakes up; the counter is reset to zero when the bias is switched off and partial networking is re-enabled.

Partial networking is assumed to be configured correctly when PNCOK is set to 1 by the application software. The TJA1145A clears PNCOK after a write access to any of the CAN partial networking configuration registers (see Section 7.3.3).

If selective wake-up is disabled (CPNC = 0) or partial networking is not configured correctly (PNCOK = 0), and the CAN transceiver is in Offline mode with wake-up enabled (CWE = 1), then any valid wake-up pattern (according to ISO 11898-2:2016) will trigger a wake-up event.

If the CAN transceiver is not in Offline mode (CMC  00) or CAN wake-up is disabled (CWE = 0), all wake-up patterns on the bus will be ignored.

CAN bit rates of 50 kbit/s, 100 kbit/s, 125 kbit/s, 250 kbit/s, 500 kbit/s and 1 Mbit/s are supported during selective wake-up. The bit rate is selected via bits CDR (see Table 9).

## 7.3.2 CAN FD frames

CAN FD stands for 'CAN with Flexible Data-Rate'. It is based on the CAN protocol as specified in ISO 11898-1:2015.

CAN FD is being gradually introduced into the automotive market. In time, all CAN controllers will be required to comply with the new standard (enabling 'FD-active' nodes) or at least to tolerate CAN FD communication (enabling 'FD-passive' nodes). The TJA1145Ax/FD variants support FD-passive features by means of a dedicated implementation of the partial networking protocol.

These variants can be configured to recognize CAN FD frames as valid frames. When CFDC = 1, the error counter is decremented every time the control field of a CAN FD frame is received. The TJA1145Ax/FD remains in low-power mode (CAN FD-passive) with partial networking enabled. CAN FD frames are never recognized as valid wake-up frames, even if PNDM = 0 and the frame contains a valid ID. After receiving the control field of a CAN FD frame, the TJA1145Ax/FD ignores further bus signals until idle is again detected.

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

CAN FD passive is supported up to a ratio of one-to-eight between arbitration and data bit rates, without unwanted wake-ups. The CAN FD filter parameter defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and SAE J2284 is supported up to a ratio of one-to-four, with a maximum supported bit data bit rate of 2 Mbit/s and a maximum arbitration speed of 500 kbit/s.

CAN FD frames are interpreted as frames with errors by the partial networking module in the TJA1145AT and TJA1145ATK, and in the TJA1145Ax/FD variants when CFDC = 0. So the error counter is incremented when a CAN FD frame is received. If the ratio of CAN FD frames to valid CAN frames exceeds the threshold that triggers error counter overflow, bit PNFDE is set to 1 and the device wakes up.

## 7.4 Fail-safe features

## 7.4.1 TXD dominant time-out

A TXD dominant time-out timer is started when pin TXD is forced LOW while the transceiver is in Active Mode. If the LOW state on pin TXD persists for longer than the TXD dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD goes HIGH. The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of 15 kbit/s.

When the TXD dominant time-out time is exceeded, a CAN failure interrupt is generated (CF = 1; see Table 19), if enabled (CFE = 1; see Table 22). In addition, the status of the TXD dominant time-out can be read via the CFS bit in the Transceiver status register (Table 8) and bit CTS is set to 0.

## 7.4.2 Pull-up on TXD pin

Pin TXD has an internal pull-up towards VIO to ensure a safe defined recessive driver state in case the pin is left floating.

## 7.4.3 VCC undervoltage event

When CMC = 01 and the supply to the CAN transceiver (VCC) falls below Vuvd(VCC), a CAN failure event is captured (CF = 1), assuming CAN failure detection is enabled (CFE = 1), and status bit VCS is set to 1.

## 7.4.4 Loss of power at pin BAT

A loss of power at pin BAT has no influence on the bus lines or on the microcontroller. No reverse currents will flow from the bus.

## 7.5 Local wake-up via WAKE pin

Local wake-up is enabled via bits WPRE and WPFE in the WAKE pin event capture enable register (see Table 23). A wake-up event is triggered by a LOW-to-HIGH (if WPRE = 1) and/or a HIGH-to-LOW (if WPFE = 1) transition on the WAKE pin. This arrangement allows for maximum flexibility when designing a local wake-up circuit. In applications that don't make use of the local wake-up facility, local wake-up should be disabled and the WAKE pin connected to GND to ensure optimal EMI performance.

| 1     | WPVS     | R        |         | WAKE pin status:                                          |
|       |          |          | 0       | voltage on WAKE pin below switching threshold (V th(sw) ) |

While the TJA1145A is in Normal mode, the status of the voltage on pin WAKE can always be read via bit WPVS. Otherwise, WPVS is only valid if local wake-up is enabled (WPRE = 1 and/or WPFE = 1).

## 7.6 Wake-up and interrupt event diagnosis via pin RXD

Wake-up and interrupt event diagnosis in the TJA1145A is intended to provide the microcontroller with information on the status of a range of features and functions. This information is stored in the event status registers (Table 18 to Table 20) and is signaled on pin RXD pin, if enabled.

A distinction is made between regular wake-up events and interrupt events (at least one regular wake-up source must be enabled to allow the TJA1145A to switch to Sleep mode; see Section 7.1.1.3).

PO and PNFDE interrupts are always captured. Wake-up and interrupt detection can be enabled/disabled for the remaining events individually via the event capture enable registers (Table 21 to Table 23).

If an event occurs while the associated event capture function is enabled, the relevant event status bit is set. If the transceiver is in CAN Offline mode, pin RXD is forced LOW to indicate that a wake-up or interrupt event has been detected. If the TJA1145A is in Sleep mode when an event (other than a SPIF interrupt) occurs, pin INH is forced HIGH and the TJA1145A switches to Standby mode. If the TJA1145A is in Standby mode when the event occurs, pin RXD is forced LOW to flag an interrupt/wake-up event. The detection of any enabled wake-up or interrupt event will trigger a wake-up in Standby mode. The detection of any enabled wake-up or interrupt event other than a SPIF interrupt will trigger a wake-up in Sleep mode.

The microcontroller can monitor events via the event status registers. An extra status register, the Global event status register (Table 17), is provided to help speed up software polling routines. By polling the Global event status register, the microcontroller can quickly determine the type of event captured (system, transceiver or WAKE) and then query the relevant table (Table 18, Table 19 or Table 20 respectively).

After the event source has been identified, the status flag should be cleared (set to 0) by writing 1 to the relevant bit (writing 0 will have no effect). A number of status bits can be cleared in a single write operation by writing 1 to all relevant bits.

It is strongly recommended to clear only the status bits that were set to 1 when the status registers were last read. This precaution ensures that events triggered just before the write access are not lost.

## 7.6.1 Interrupt/wake-up delay

If interrupt or wake-up events occur very frequently while the transceiver is in CAN Offline mode, they can have a significant impact on the software processing time (because pin RXD is repeatedly driven LOW, requiring a response from the microcontroller each time an interrupt/wake-up is generated). The TJA1145A incorporates an interrupt/wake-up delay timer to limit the disturbance to the software.

When one of the event capture status bits is cleared, pin RXD is released (HIGH) and a timer is started. If further events occur while the timer is running, the relevant status bits are set. If one or more events are pending when the timer expires after td(event), pin RXD goes LOW again to alert the microcontroller.

In this way, the microcontroller is interrupted once to process a number of events rather than several times to process individual events. If all active event capture bits have been cleared (by the microcontroller) when the timer expires after td(event), pin RXD remains HIGH (since there are no pending events). The event capture registers can be read at any time.

## 7.6.2 Sleep mode protection

It is very important that event detection is configured correctly when the TJA1145A switches to Sleep mode to ensure it will respond to a wake-up event. For this reason, and to avoid potential system deadlocks, at least one regular wake-up event must be enabled and all event status bits must be cleared before the TJA1145A switches to Sleep mode. Otherwise the TJA1145A will switch to Standby mode in response to a go-to-sleep command (MC = 001).

## 7.6.3 Event status and event capture registers

After an event source has been identified, the status flag should be cleared (set to 0) by writing 1 to the relevant status bit (writing 0 will have no effect).

## 7.9 General-purpose memory

TJA1145A allocates 4 bytes of memory for general-purpose registers used to store user information. The general purpose registers can be accessed via the SPI at address 0x06 to 0x09 (see Table 26).

## 7.10 VIO supply pin

Pin VIO should be connected to the microcontroller supply voltage. This will cause the signal levels of the TXD, RXD and the SPI interface pins to be adjusted to the I/O levels of the microcontroller, enabling direct interfacing without the need for glue logic.

## 7.11 VCC/VIO undervoltage protection

If an undervoltage is detected on pins VCC or VIO, and it remains valid for longer than the undervoltage detection delay time, td(uvd), the TJA1145A is forced to Sleep mode (see Figure 4). A number of preventative measures are taken when the TJA1145A is forced to Sleep mode to avoid deadlock and unpredictable states:

- All previously captured events (address range 0x61 to 0x64) are cleared before the TJA1145A switches to Sleep Mode to avoid repeated attempts to wake up while an undervoltage is present.
- Both CAN wake-up (CWE = 1) and local wake-up via the WAKE pin (WPFE = WPRE = 1) are enabled in order to avoid a deadlock situation where the TJA1145A cannot be woken up after entering Sleep mode.
- Partial Networking is disabled (CPNC = 0) to ensure immediate wake-up in response to bus traffic after the TJA1145A has recovered from an undervoltage event.
- The Partial Networking Configuration bit is cleared (CPNOK = 0) to indicate that partial networking might not have been configured correctly when the TJA1145A switched to Sleep mode.

Status bit FSMS is set to 1 when a transition to Sleep mode is forced by an undervoltage event (see Table 6). This bit can be sampled after the TJA1145A wakes up from Sleep mode to allow the settings of CWE, WPFE, WPRE and CPNC to be re-adjusted if an undervoltage event forced the transition to Sleep mode (FSMS = 1).

## 7.12 SPI

## 7.12.1 Introduction

The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) provides the communication link with the microcontroller, supporting multi-slave operations. The SPI is configured for full duplex data transfer, so status information is returned when new control data is shifted in. The interface also offers a read-only access option, allowing registers to be read back by the application without changing the register content.

The SPI uses four interface signals for synchronization and data transfer:

- SCSN: SPI chip select; active LOW; default level is HIGH (pull-up)
- SCK: SPI clock; default level is LOW due to internal pull-down
- SDI: SPI data input
- SDO: SPI data output; floating when pin SCSN is HIGH (may need external pull-up or pull-down if not available in the host controller)

Bit sampling is performed on the falling edge of the clock and data is shifted in/out on the rising edge, as illustrated in Figure 10.

<!-- image -->

The SPI data in the TJA1145A is stored in a number of dedicated 8-bit registers. Each register is assigned a unique 7-bit address. Two bytes (16 bits) must be transmitted to the TJA1145A for a single register read or write operation. The first byte contains the 7-bit address along with a 'read-only' bit (the LSB). The read-only bit must be 0 to indicate a write operation (if this bit is 1, a read operation is assumed and any data on the SDI pin is ignored). The second byte contains the data to be written to the register.

24- and 32-bit read and write operations are also supported. The register address is automatically incremented, once for a 24-bit operation and twice for a 32-bit operation, as illustrated in Figure 11.

Fig 11. SPI data structure for a write operation (16-, 24- or 32-bit)

<!-- image -->

During an SPI data read or write operation, the contents of the addressed register(s) is returned via pin SDO.

The TJA1145A tolerates attempts to write to registers that don't exist. If the available address space is exceeded during a write operation, the data above the valid address range is ignored (without generating an SPI failure event).

During a write operation, the TJA1145A monitors the number of SPI bits transmitted. If the number recorded is not 16, 24 or 32, then the write operation is aborted and an SPI failure event is captured (SPIF = 1).

If more than 32 bits are clocked in on pin SDI during a read operation, the data stream on SDI is reflected on SDO from bit 33 onwards.

## 7.12.2 Register map

The addressable register space contains 128 registers with addresses from 0x00 to 0x7F. An overview of the register mapping is provided in Table 26 to Table 30. The functionality of the individual bits is discussed in more detail in relevant sections of the data sheet.

## 7.12.3 Register configuration in TJA1145A operating modes

A number of register bits may change state automatically when the TJA1145A switches from one operating mode to another. This is particularly evident when the TJA1145A switches to Off mode or when an undervoltage event forces a transition to Sleep mode. These changes are summarized in Table 31. If an SPI transmission is in progress when the TJA1145A changes state, the transmission is ignored (automatic state changes have priority).

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

- [11] In accordance with IEC 60747-1. An alternative definition of virtual junction temperature is: Tvj = Tamb + P  Rth(j-a) , where Rth(j-a) is a fixed value used in the calculation of Tvj. The rating for Tvj limits the allowable combinations of power dissipation (P) and ambient temperature (Tamb).

All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.

## 16. Soldering of SMD packages

This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 'Surface mount reflow soldering description' .

## 16.1 Introduction to soldering

Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high densities that come with increased miniaturization.

## 16.2 Wave and reflow soldering

Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:

- Through-hole components
- Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board

Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, due to an increased probability of bridging.

The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.

Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:

- Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
- Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
- The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
- Package placement
- Inspection and repair
- Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

## High-speed CAN transceiver for partial networking

- Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are exposed to the wave
- Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

## 16.4 Reflow soldering

Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:

- Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 20) than a SnPb process, thus reducing the process window
- Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process window for a mix of large and small components on one board
- Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with Table 36 and 37

| 1.6 to 2.5               | 260                                 | 250                                 | 245                                 |
| > 2.5                    | 250                                 | 245                                 | 245                                 |

Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all times.

Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow soldering, see Figure 20.
